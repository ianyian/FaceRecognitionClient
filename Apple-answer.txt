GUIDELINE 2.1 - FACE DATA INFORMATION
================================================================================

QUESTION 1: What face data does the app collect?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER:

The app collects the following face data:

1. FACE LANDMARKS (Mathematical Coordinates):
   - 478 3D coordinate points representing facial features (x, y, z positions)
   - These landmarks are extracted using Google's MediaPipe Face Landmarker model
   - Landmarks include positions for: eyes (10 iris points), eyebrows, nose, mouth, 
     chin, cheeks, jawline, and facial contour (468 face mesh points)
   - Each landmark is stored as normalized coordinates (0.0 to 1.0 range)

2. KEY FACIAL FEATURE POINTS (33 critical landmarks):
   - Eye centers (iris positions)
   - Eye corners (inner/outer boundaries)
   - Eyebrow positions
   - Nose tip, bridge, and base
   - Mouth corners and lip boundaries
   - Chin, cheeks, and jawline points
   - Forehead center

3. WHAT IS NOT COLLECTED:
   - Raw photographs are NOT stored permanently
   - Camera images are NOT saved to Firebase or any server
   - Live video streams are NOT recorded
   - Facial images are only processed temporarily in device memory during check-in

4. DATA FORMAT:
   - Face data is stored as JSON arrays of numerical coordinates
   - Example: {"x": 0.456, "y": 0.678, "z": 0.012, "type": "LEFT_EYE"}
   - Total storage per student: approximately 5-8KB of coordinate data


QUESTION 2: Provide a complete and clear explanation of all planned uses of the collected face data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER:

The face data is used EXCLUSIVELY for the following purposes:

1. STUDENT IDENTITY VERIFICATION (Primary Use):
   - When a student arrives at the tuition center, staff captures their face using the camera
   - The app extracts 478 facial landmarks from the camera image (processed locally)
   - These landmarks are compared against enrolled students' landmarks in the database
   - If similarity exceeds 70% threshold, the student is identified
   - Attendance is recorded with timestamp and student ID

2. STUDENT ENROLLMENT:
   - During enrollment, staff captures 1-3 photos of the student
   - MediaPipe extracts facial landmarks from each photo
   - Landmarks are stored in Firebase Firestore linked to the student's account
   - This creates the reference data for future identity verification

3. ATTENDANCE MATCHING ALGORITHM:
   - Camera landmarks vs. Database landmarks comparison
   - Euclidean distance calculation between corresponding landmark points
   - Overall similarity score (0-100%) computed using weighted average
   - Best match is selected if score exceeds 70% confidence threshold
   - Result: Check-in recorded or "No match found" message

4. WHAT WE DO NOT DO:
   - NO facial recognition for marketing, advertising, or profiling
   - NO sharing of face data with third parties for any commercial purpose
   - NO use of face data for emotion detection, age estimation, or demographic analysis
   - NO cross-referencing with external databases or social media
   - NO sale of facial data to any entity


QUESTION 3: Will the face data be shared with any third parties? Where will this information be stored?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER:

GUIDELINE 2.1 - DEMO ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS
================================================================================

QUESTION: We were unable to sign in with the demo account credentials provided (demo01 / helloworld).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER:

We apologize for the incorrect credentials. The correct demo account is:

CORRECTED DEMO ACCOUNT:
- Email: demo01@gmail.com
- Password: helloworld
- School ID: demo01

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR APPLE REVIEWER:

1. LOGIN PROCESS:
   - Open the app
   - Enter email: demo01@gmail.com (NOT just "demo01")
   - Enter password: helloworld
   - Enter school: demo01
   - Tap "Login"

2. DEMO ACCOUNT CAPABILITIES:
   - The demo account has ADMIN privileges
   - You can view 5 pre-enrolled sample students with face data
   - You can simulate attendance check-in (camera will work but matching uses demo data)
   - You can view attendance history and reports
   - You can access all app features (student management, settings, etc.)

3. PRE-ENROLLED STUDENTS IN DEMO:
   - 5 sample students with face landmark data already enrolled
   - You can test face matching with any face - the app will show similarity scores
   - Check-in will work and create attendance records

4. CRITICAL FIRST STEP - DOWNLOAD FACE DATA:
   **IMPORTANT:** Before testing face recognition, you MUST download face data to the device:
   - After logging in, go to Settings (gear icon in top navigation)
   - Scroll down to find "Re-download Face Data" button
   - Tap the button and wait for download to complete (5-10 seconds)
   - You'll see a confirmation message: "Face data downloaded successfully"
   
   WHY THIS IS REQUIRED:
   - Face matching is performed LOCALLY on the device (not on server)
   - Face landmark data must be cached on device memory for real-time comparison
   - Without downloading, the app CANNOT match faces and will always show "No match found"
   - This local processing design ensures privacy - no face images sent to server during check-in
   - Only mathematical landmarks are downloaded (about 5-8KB per student)

5. TESTING FACE RECOGNITION:
   - AFTER completing Step 4 (downloading face data), tap "Attendance" or camera icon
   - Allow camera permission when prompted
   - Point camera at any face (your own face is fine for testing)
   - App will detect facial landmarks in real-time
   - App compares detected landmarks against downloaded student data
   - You'll see similarity scores (0-100%) and best match result
   - If "No match found" appears, verify face data was downloaded in Settings

6. IF LOGIN FAILS:
   - Ensure device has internet connection
   - Firebase authentication requires active network
   - Try closing and reopening the app
   - Check that School ID is exactly "demo01" (lowercase)

QUESTION 3: What features in the app, if any, are intended for use by the general public?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER:

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: This app is B2B (Business-to-Business), NOT B2C (Business-to-Consumer).

The app is NOT designed for general public consumers. It is specifically designed for STAFF MEMBERS of educational institutions (tuition centers, schools, etc.).

Users of the App:
- School administrators (set up system, manage staff accounts)
- Teachers (view student information, attendance records)
- Reception staff (perform daily check-in/check-out operations)

End Beneficiaries (Not App Users):
- Students (their attendance is tracked but they don't use the app)
- Parents (receive WhatsApp notifications but don't use the app)

No Public-Facing Features:
- There is NO student-facing mobile app
- There is NO parent portal or app
- General public cannot download and use this app for personal purposes

Distribution Model:
- Each tuition center purchases a subscription (business license)
- The tuition center creates staff accounts for their employees
- Staff members download the app and log in with institution credentials
- Data is isolated per institution (School A cannot see School B's data)

This is similar to business apps like:
- Square Point of Sale (used by retail staff, not shoppers)
- Shopify POS (used by store employees, not customers)
- Toast Restaurant POS (used by restaurant staff, not diners)


QUESTION 4: How do users obtain an account?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER:

ACCOUNT CREATION PROCESS:

Current Process (Version 1.0 - Pilot Phase):
1. Tuition center owner/manager contacts us via email (ianyian@gmail.com)
2. We create an ADMIN account for the institution
3. We provide: School ID, Admin email, and temporary password
4. Admin logs into the app using their iOS device
5. Admin creates additional staff accounts (teachers, reception staff) within the app
6. Staff members download the app and log in with credentials provided by their admin

Future Process (Version 1.1+ - Self-Service):
1. Tuition center visits our website (https://ianyian.github.io/FaceRecognitionClient)
2. Completes online signup form (organization name, contact info)
3. Receives school ID and admin credentials via email
4. Downloads app from App Store
5. Logs in and completes setup wizard

Important Notes:
- Individual consumers CANNOT sign up for personal use
- Only registered educational institutions receive accounts
- Staff accounts are created by the institution's admin (not by individual staff members)
- Email verification required during account setup
- Each institution has a unique School ID (e.g., "demo01", "sunrise-tuition", etc.)


QUESTION 5: Is there any paid content in the app and if so who pays for it? For example, do users pay for opening an account or using certain features in the app?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Generate new iPad screenshots at correct dimensions (2048×2732 pixels)
2. Design screenshots specifically for iPad display format
3. Ensure screenshots show authentic iPad UI without stretching or distortion
4. Upload new iPad screenshots to App Store Connect
5. Screenshots will accurately represent the app running on iPad Pro 13" / 12.9" display

ACTION TIMELINE:
- New iPad screenshots will be created and uploaded within 24-48 hours
- Screenshots will be captured from actual iPad simulator/device
- All screenshots will meet Apple's quality and authenticity requirements

We are committed to providing accurate screenshots that properly represent our app on all supported devices.


================================================================================
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
================================================================================

FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY DETAILS:

Algorithm Used:
- Google MediaPipe Face Landmarker (open-source, industry-standard)
- Same technology used in Google Photos, YouTube, and other Google products
- Model File: face_landmarker.task (included in app bundle, 11MB)
- Documentation: https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker

How It Works:
1. Camera captures image (UIImage object in iOS)
2. Image sent to MediaPipe Face Landmarker framework
3. MediaPipe detects face and extracts 478 3D coordinate landmarks
4. Landmarks converted to JSON array of {x, y, z, type} objects
5. JSON stored in Firebase Firestore under student's record
6. During check-in: New landmarks compared to stored landmarks
7. Euclidean distance calculated between corresponding points
8. Similarity score computed (0-100%)
9. If score > 70%, match is confirmed and attendance recorded

Privacy by Design:
- All face detection happens ON-DEVICE (no cloud API calls for face processing)
- MediaPipe runs locally using iOS Metal GPU acceleration
- Only numerical coordinates leave the device (never raw images)
- Camera images never touch Firebase servers

COMPLIANCE & CERTIFICATIONS:

- COPPA Compliant (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
- GDPR Compliant (General Data Protection Regulation)
- PDPA Compliant (Personal Data Protection Act - Malaysia)
- SOC 2 Type II (via Firebase infrastructure)
- ISO 27001 (via Firebase/Google Cloud)

Parental Consent Process:
1. Tuition center obtains written consent from parents before enrollment
2. Consent form explains face recognition, data storage, and retention
3. Parents can opt-out (student uses manual check-in with student ID card)
4. Signed consent forms stored by tuition center (not in our app)

Data Subject Rights:
- Parents can request access to their child's face data
- Parents can request deletion at any time
- Tuition center admin processes requests via app settings
- Deletion is immediate and permanent
